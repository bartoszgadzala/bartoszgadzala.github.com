According to "Dart's technical overview":http://www.dartlang.org/docs/technical-overview/index.html:

bq. Dart is a new class-based programming language for creating structured web applications. Developed with the goals of simplicity, efficiency, and scalability, the Dart language combines powerful new language features with familiar language constructs into a clear, readable syntax.

Dart comes with Dart Editor which is based on Eclipse, so if you are familiar with Eclipse, you won't have any problems using it. Dart Editor is available "here":http://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-integration/latest/ for Linux, Mac and Windows (both 32-bit and 64-bit). After downloading, simply unzip it in choosen directory and run DartEditor executable - check "this":http://www.dartlang.org/docs/getting-started/editor/index-linux.html tutorial if you are stuck.

To create new Dart application, choose _File / New Application_ and provide name (I've used *Quickstart* but you can choose other if you like):

This will generate simple Hello World application in Dart. There are only two files (*Note:* they will be named differently, if you've choosed different application name):
* Quickstart.html - template of application view:

{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Quickstart</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Quickstart</h1>
    <h2 id="status">dart is not running</h2>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="Quickstart.dart.app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

* Quickstart.dart - application code:

{% highlight javascript %}
#import('dart:html');

class Quickstart {

  Quickstart() {
  }

  void run() {
    write("Hello World!");
  }

  void write(String message) {
    // the HTML library defines a global "document" variable
    document.query('#status').innerHTML = message;
  }
}

void main() {
  new Quickstart().run();
}
{% endhighlight %}

To run application, choose _Tools / Run in Browser_, which will open new browser window with our application within:
